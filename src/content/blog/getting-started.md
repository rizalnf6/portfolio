# Getting Started with Astro

Astro is a modern static site builder that offers incredible performance by shipping zero JavaScript by default. In this post, I'll share my experience getting started with Astro and why I chose it for my portfolio site.

## Why Astro?

Astro provides several advantages over other frameworks:

- **Performance First**: Ships minimal JavaScript for faster page loads
- **Component Islands**: Use your favorite UI components (React, Vue, Svelte)
- **Simple Mental Model**: Feels like building a multi-page application
- **Markdown Support**: First-class support for content-focused sites

## Setting Up an Astro Project

Getting started with Astro is straightforward. Here's how I set up my project:

```js
// Install Astro
npm create astro@latest

// Follow the prompts to create your project
```
